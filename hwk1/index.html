				I am a junior at Santa Clara University majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. I am orignially from Sacramento, CA where I was born and raised. In my free time I enjoy watching a wide variety of sports which basketball, football, and soccer. I recreationaly play baksetball when time permits. I have played basketball since the second grade so it is a pastime I enjoy to do as much as possible. Along with playing athletics I also help coordinate a youth basketball league during the summers. The summer league involves kids who are going into the second and third grade. They play games every Friday against a new team so that each kid can play as many others as possible.I am a junior at Santa Clara University majoring in Computer Science and Engineering.
